Gamma-ray angular distributions

             This example is identical to the simulation of the 1329 keV
	     2+ -> 0+ gamma ray in 44S in ./examples/inbeam/fit
	     except that it simulates the gamma-ray angular
	     distribution resulting from alignment of the
	     reaction product (100% oblate alignment).

	     An isotropic angular distribution is also simulated, and
	     the root script angDist.C compares the angular
	     distributions of the emitted gamma rays (isotropic in blue,
	     aligned in red) for comparison.
