  Parameters p0-p3 specify two exponentials to fit the prompt
  background. Parameter p4 scales the measured background (not present
  in this simulated "measurement").

  Parameters p5-p7 scale the simulations of in-beam excitations of the
  first two 2+ states and the 4+ state of 44S.  Multiply the
  scaling factor by the number of events simulated (1E5 here) to get
  the number of times the corresponding excited states were populated in
  the experiment to produce measured spectrum.

      2+ state at 1329 keV:  1700 +/-650  (2000 exact)
      2+ state at 2150 keV:  1120 +/-220  (1000 exact)
      4+ state at 2457 keV:  4900 +/-410  (5000 exact)

  (The exact scaling factors for the peaks are known, because this is
   simulated data generated in the ./makeData subdirectory.)

================================================================================
To set up your own fit ...

- Make a copy of the fit example subdirectory.

  $ cp -r fit <destination path>

- Make a new set of .mac files for the beam, target, and gamma rays
  you want to simulate.

- Produce a level data file for your outgoing reaction product. A
  large collection of files is provided with Geant4 in the
  PhotonEvaporationX.X data files. A local copy is needed with three
  gamma-ray angular distribution coefficients appended to each
  line. Only levels populated in the reaction of interest (and via
  de-excitation of these levels) need be included in the
  file. Including additional levels will not impact performance.

- Modify the list of targets at the top of the Makefile.

- Use ./change_geometry.sh to point to the geometry files for your
  GRETINA configuration 

- Analyze the (simulated) reaction products to determine the
  analysis beta and the average post-target kinetic energy of your
  reaction products.

    analysis beta (set in gvalues.val file):

      The ideal beta value to use in Doppler reconstruction of
      gamma-ray spectra is the average beta of the reaction products
      at the times they emitted gamma rays. This depends on the target
      material and thickness and on the lifetime of the excited state
      in question, so it is important that these parameters match
      those you use in your gamma-ray simulation. Use the average of
      the simulated beta spectrum --- the specrum called "sim/beta" in
      the GRUTinizer histogram file provided
      (./util/GRUTinizer/MakeHistosInbeam.cxx) and "hbeta" in the
      GrROOT histogram file provided (./util/GrROOT/SimHistograms.cc).

      In the current example 9Be(44S, 44S') at 100 MeV/A, 0.4169.

    average post-target beam energy (set in the macro files):

      UCGretina writes simulated S800 data (ATA, BTA, DTA, YTA only)
      for each event in a gamma ray(s) is detected. The kinetic energy
      corresponding to the center of the S800 acceptance is set in
      each macro file with the /Mode2/S800KE command. For experimental
      data, this should be set based on the actual S800 setting. For
      purely simulated data, the average kinetic energy of the
      outgoing reaction product post-target can be used. The DTA
      spectrum is named "s800/dta" in the GRUTinizer histogram library
      provided (./util/GRUTinizer/MakeHistosInbeam.cxx) and "dta" in
      the GrROOT histogram file provided
      (./util/GrROOT/SimHistograms.cc). 

- Make a modified version of s44Fit.C: 

  * Modify the function fitf() so that it combines the correct 
    number of simulations.

  * Modify the file names (the measured spectrum and the
    simulations) in the main function --- s44Fit(), and set the
    variable nSim to reflect the number of excited states simulated.
