This example illustrates a simulation of an in-beam measurement with a
user-supplied level data file. The level data file follows the format
of those supplied with the Geant4 PhotonEvaporationX.X data files with
three gamma-ray angular distribution coefficients appended to each
line. See $G4LEVELGAMMADATA/README-LevelGammaData for a detailed
description of the format. If needed, Internal conversion coefficients
interpolated from measured data can be obtained using the BrIcc
Conversion Coefficient Calculator (http://bricc.anu.edu.au/).

In this example, a fictional level scheme of 44S is specified in the
file parallel.lvldata. It describes an excited state at 2000 keV which
decays with zero lifetime either to a state at 1500 keV with BR 0.25
or to a state at 1200 keV with BR 0.75. Both intermediate states decay
with one branch directly to the ground state.

The macro file parallel.mac populates this level scheme at 2000 keV. 
Each simulated event follows one of two possible cascades: 

    2000 -> 1500 -> 1200 -> 0    and    2000 -> 1200 -> 0

The resulting spectrum will show gamma rays at 300, 500, 800, and 1200
keV, and the resulting output will show the corresponding gamma-gamma
coincidence relationships.
