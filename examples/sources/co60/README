================================================================================

Realistic gamma-ray cascades from stationary sources can be simulated
using the 

    /BeamOut/Source

command. The macro file co60.mac illustrates this approach.
Descriptions of transitions de-exciting states of the daughter nucleus
(60Ni) are read from the level data file z28.a60.lvldata, which is
provided with the PhotonEvaporationX.X data files.

In order to simulate angular correlations, the functionality must be
activated in >geant4.10.3. Set the fCorrelatedGamma flag to true in
<PATH TO
GEANT4.10>/source/processes/hadronic/models/de_excitation/management/src/G4DeexPrecoParameters.cc,
recompile and reinstall geant4, and recompile UCGretina.

The GRUTinizer histogram library
./util/GRUTinizer/MakeHistos60CoSim.cxx is provided. The
sim/emitted_delta spectrum shows the cos(theta) histogram, where theta
is the angle between the 1332 and 1173 keV gamma rays. If angular
correlations have been successfully activated, this specrum will not
be flat.

The position/delta is the cos(theta) spectrum of 1332-1172 keV
coincidence events observed by GRETINA. The ./angCorr.C script
produces an angular distribution plot by dividing the position/delta
spectrum by that from a simulation with no angular correlation.

o Running the simulation

  - In this directory, type

      $ make

    to run the simulations of the 60Co source described in
    co60_gammas.mac, co60.mac and sort with GRUITinizer. To sort with
    GrROOT,

      $ make -f Makefile.GrROOT

  - UCGretina writes mode 2 data to co60.dat. (The names of the output
    files are specified in the .mac files.)

  - GRUTinizer or GrROOT sorts the mode 2 data in the .dat files into 
    histograms in co60_histos.root.
