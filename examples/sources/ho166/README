================================================================================

The macro file ho166.mac simulates a 166Ho source using the  

    /BeamOut/Source

command.

Descriptions of transitions de-exciting states of the
daughter nucleus (166Er) are read from the level data file
z68.a166.ad.lvldata, which is a modified version of that provided with
the PhotonEvaporationX.X data files, truncated to include levels
populated by beta decay / EC and with isotropic angular distribution
coefficients appended.

The activity of a 166Ho source arises from the beta- decay of a very
long-lived 5.696 keV isomer instead of the ground state. To avoid the
ground-state decay, decay data for 166Ho is read from a modified file 
z67.a166.decaydata using the 

    /grdm/setRadioactiveDecayFile 

command. The modified file is derived from the version provided with the
Geant4 RadioactiveDecayX.X.X data files, but modified to treat the
5.696 keV isomer as the ground state.

o Running the simulations

  - In this directory, type

      $ make

    to run the simulation of the 166Ho source described in
    ho166.mac and sort with GRUITinizer. To sort with
    GrROOT,

      $ make -f Makefile.GrROOT

  - UCGretina writes mode 2 data to ho166.dat. (The name of the output
    file is specified in the .mac file.)

  - GRUTinizer or GrROOT sorts the mode 2 data in the .dat file into 
    histograms in ho166_histos.root. (The GRUTinizer histogram library
    ./util/GRUTinizer/MakeHistosSourcesSim.cxx is provided.)
