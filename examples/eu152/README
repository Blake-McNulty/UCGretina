Several gamma-ray calibration sources are implemented in UCGretina
which can be accessed with the 

    /Experiment/RunSource

and 

    /Experiment/Source/Set

commands. The macro file eu152_gammas.mac illustrates this
approach. These simulations are based on intensities adopted by the
IAEA for standard calibration sources.

In addition, realistic gamma-ray cascades from stationary sources can
be simulated using the 

    /BeamOut/Source

command. The collection of macro files sm152_<Level Energy>.mac and
gd152_<Level Energy>.mac macro files illustrate this approach. The
number of events simulated for each level corresponds to the number of
decays to that level per 1E6 decays. Level data is read from the files
z62.a152 and z64.a152 which are versions of those provided with the
PhotonEvaporation data files, truncated to include levels populated by
beta decay / EC and with isotropic angular distribution coefficients
appended.

o Run the simulations

  - In this directory, type

      $ make

    to run the simulations of the 152Eu source described in
    eu152_gammas.mac, sm152_<Level Energy>.mac, and
    gd152_<Level Energy>.mac. The Makefile automates the following
    steps:

  - UCGretina writes mode 2 data to eu152_gammas.dat,
    sm152_<Level Energy>.dat, and gd152_<Level Energy>.dat. (The names
    of the output files are specified in the .mac files.)

  - GRUTinizer sorts the mode 2 data in the .dat files into 
    histograms in eu152_gammas_histos.root,
    sm152_<Level Energy>_histos.root, and
    gd152_<Level Energy>_histos.root.

  - gadd (a GRUTinizer utility) combines the
    sm152_<Level Energy>_histos.root, and
    gd152_<Level Energy>_histos.root into a full 152Eu spectrum in
    eu152_histos.root.

o Fit a measured spectrum

  - The root files ./data/run022_cal_histos.root and 
    ./data/run007_cal_histos.root are measured 152Eu and room
    background spectra measured with the standard NSCL configuration
    of Gretina in September 2012.

  - The root script eu152Fit.C fits the measured spectrum with a
    linear combination of the room background and simulated
    spectra. (The background scaling is set with a fit above 1540
    keV.)

      $ root
      $ .L eu152Fit.C
      $ fitSpectrum()

    The simulated spectrum is the response to 1E6 gamma rays, and fit
    parameter 1 is the scaling factor. The measured spectrum
    corresponds to 

      Run020: free running, 595.6 live seconds, 9/17/2012
      Source activity:
      (313100(4400) Bq on 5/1/1978)*(0.5)^(34.3819 years/13.537 years) 
                        = 53841(754) Bq

        (53841(750) Bq)*(595.6 seconds)*(1.537 gamma rays/decay) 
                        =  4.93(7)E7 gamma rays emitted

    so the scaling factor (parameter p1 in the fit results below)
    should be 49.3(7).

  - The fixed parameters p2 and p3 are threshold parameters. Freeing
    these finds the best-fit threshold parameters for the entire
    array. However, it is preferable to determine threshold parameters
    crystal-by-crystal and fold in simulated crystal thresholds at the 
    SimCalculate stage as is done here (thresholds in run020_run007.thresh).

    (This only affects lab-frame energies below about 200 keV --- not
    always worth pursuing.)
