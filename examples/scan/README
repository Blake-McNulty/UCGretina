Scanning Table Example: pencil beam
================================================================================
Notes

- The scanning table positions a collimated source under the
  crystal nearest the slit assembly (crystal 124 in this example),
  which produces a vertical pencil beam. (Geometry files that place a quad
  in the scanning table with crystals 124-127 in the front position are
  located in ./GretinaGeometry/Scan0 - ./GretinaGeometry/Scan3.)

- In the output, crystals 124-127 are the GRETINA module, crystals
  129-132 are the left clover detector and crystals 133-136 are the right
  clover detector (facing the table). 

- (Unfortunately) there are three relevant coordinate systems:

      Geant4/UCGretina: X horizontal (left facing the table)
                        Y vertical   (up)
                        Z horizontal (from the slits to back of the table)

      Table controller: X horizontal (right facing the table)
                        Y horizontal (from the slits to back of the table)
                        Z vertical   (up)

      GRETINA crystal:  X tilted     (~16 deg above G4/UCG Z, controller Y)
                        Y horizontal (left, G4/UCG X, -controller X)
                        Z tilted     (crystal axis; ~16 deg from G4/UCG Y)

- The positioning of the collimator and source are specified
  in the scanning-table controller coordinates with the

      /ScanningTable/SetControllerX
      /ScanningTable/SetControllerY

  commands.

  The vertical position of the slit mask is specified in
  scanning-table controller coordiates with the

      /ScanningTable/SetControllerZ

  command.

  The usual source positioning commands (`/Experiment/Source/setX`, 
  `/Experiment/Source/setY`, `/Experiment/Source/setZ`) should not
  be used.

- The

      /Experiment/Source/CollimationDirection 0 1 0
      /Experiment/Source/CollimationAngle 0.37595 deg

  commands limit gamma-ray emission to the collimator opening, greatly
  reducing run time. Comment these out to study the (very small)
  background from incomplete gamma-ray attenuation by the collimator
  walls.

- A visualization macro (./vis/visScan.mac) for the scanning table is
  included.
