  The gamma-ray scaling factors are parameters p5-p8. Multiply the
  scaling factor by the number of events simulated (1E6 here) to
  get the number of gamma rays emitted in the experiment to produce
  measured spectrum.

  Conveniently, the exact scaling factors for the peaks are known,
  because this is simulated data. They are 

    p5 = 0.001
    p6 = 0.002
    p7 = 0.005
    p8 = 0.01

The sorting code

The root script UCGretinaSort.C reads gamma-ray interaction data from
the .out into root spectra and writes them to a .root file. It
simulates intrinsic detector resolution and thresholds based on
parameters in the file Gretina.dat. It also applies event-by-event
Doppler correction based on the beta value and target position in
Gretina.dat. Several spectra are in the .root file: combined spectra
with and without addback and spectra from individual crystals.

================================================================================
To set up your own fit ...

- Make a copy of the fit example subdirectory.

  $ cp -r fit <destination path>

- Make a new set of .mac files for the beam, target, and gamma rays you
  want to simulate.

- Modify the list of targets at the top of the Makefile.

- Modify Gretina.dat to reflect your resolution, thresholds, etc.

- Use ./change_geometry.sh to point to the geometry files for your
  GRETINA configuration 

- Analyze the (simulated) reaction products to determine the
  analysis beta:

  The first line of the file Gretina.dat specifies the source
  velocity (beta) to use in the Doppler reconstruction of
  simulated spectra. Since the Doppler reconstruction is done by
  the root script UCGretinaSort.C, this does not affect the
  simulations themselves.

  To determine the value of beta giving the best reconstruction ...

  $ UCGretina example_ions.mac > example_ions.log

  The ideal beta value to use in Doppler reconstruction of
  gamma-ray spectra is the average beta of the reaction products
  at the times they emitted gamma rays. This depends on the target
  material and thickness and on the lifetime of the excited state
  in question, so it is important that these parameters match
  those you use in your gamma-ray simulation.

  We don't have a way to measure source velocities directly in an
  experiment, but the simulation can tell us what they are.

  $ root

  root [0] .L ions.C 
  root [1] makeTree("example_ions.log")

  This will take a while to run.

  Double click on ion.betar to get the distribution of source
  betas. The mean value in the statistics box is the analysis beta
  that will match the rings. (The example fit: 100 MeV/u 44S in a
  376 mg/cm^2 9Be target and a state with 0 lifetime: 0.4168)

  Also double click on ion.betaf to find the average velocity of
  the reaction products after leaving the target and make sure
  that it agrees with the velocity you get from the S800 dta
  spectrum.

- Run the simulations:

  $ source env.sh
  $ make

- Modify Fit.C: 

  * Modify the function fitf() so that it adds in the correct 
    number of simulated gamma rays

  * Modify the file names (the measured spectrum and the
    simulations) in the function fitSpectrum(). Note that the
    simulation file names do not include extensions. This is
    intentional, and important.
