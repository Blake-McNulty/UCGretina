o 152Eu, 137Cs, 50Co, and 56Co sources are implemented in UCGretina. The
   following illustrates the use of the 152Eu source.

================================================================================
152Eu

o Run the simulation

  - Copy the version of env.sh from your local installation of geant4 to
    this directory. Then,

      $ source env.sh
      $ make

    to run the simulation of the 152Eu source measurement described in
    eu152.mac.

  - UCGretina writes gamma-ray event data to eu152.out. (The name of
    the output file is specified in eu152.mac.)

  - Once the simulation finishes, UCGretinaSourceSort.C sorts the
    event data in eu152.out into spectra and saves them in the root
    file eu152.root.

o Fit a measured spectrum

  - The NSCL ascii spectra eu152_run087_cal.asc and bg_run081_cal.asc
    are 152Eu and room background spectra measured with six GRETINA
    clusters mounted in holes 6, 7, 8, 9, 15, and 17. The euler file
    therefore includes slots 5,6,7,8,14,16. (Hole number in the
    physical manifestation of GRETINA correspons to slot numbers in
    UCGretina + 1.)

  - The root script eu152Fit.C scale the simulated
    spectrum and the room background to fit the measured spectrum:

      $ root
      $ .L eu152Fit.C
      $ fitSpectrum("eu152")

    The simulated spectrum is the response to 1E7 gamma rays, and fit
    parameter 1 is the scaling factor. The measured spectrum
    corresponds to 

    (3231 real seconds)*(4113443/4113752 live fraction)*(54300 decays/s)
         /(10 downscaling)*(1.537 simulated gammas/decay)
         = 2.696E7 downscaled decays

    so the scaling factor should be 2.696.

  - The output:

  - The fixed parameters p2-p5 are energy calibration and low-energy
    threshold parameters. They are included if ajustments are
    needed to get a rough preliminary fit. However, for best results,
    each crystal should be well-calibrated, and threshold parameters
    should be determined for each crystal and included in Gretina.dat
    (as they are in this example).
