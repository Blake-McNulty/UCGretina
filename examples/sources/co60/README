Several gamma-ray calibration sources are implemented in UCGretina
which can be accessed with the 

    /Experiment/RunSource

and 

    /Experiment/Source/Set

commands. The macro file co60_gammas.mac illustrates this
approach. These simulations are based on intensities adopted by the
IAEA for standard calibration sources.

In addition, realistic gamma-ray cascades from stationary sources can
be simulated using the 

    /BeamOut/Source

command. The macro file co60.mac illustrates this approach.
Descriptions of transitions de-exciting states of the daughter nucleus
(60Ni) are read from the level data file z28.a60.lvldata, which is
provided with the PhotonEvaporationX.X data files.

================================================================================
o Running the simulations

  - In this directory, type

      $ make

    to run the simulations of the 60Co source described in
    co60_gammas.mac, co60.mac and sort with GRUITinizer. To sort with
    GrROOT,

      $ make -f Makefile.GrROOT

  - UCGretina writes mode 2 data to co60_gammas.dat and
    co60.dat. (The names of the output files are specified in the
    .mac files.)

  - GRUTinizer or GrROOT sorts the mode 2 data in the .dat files into 
    histograms in co60_gammas_histos.root, co60_histos.root.
    (The GRUTinizer histogram library
    ./util/GRUTinizer/MakeHistosSourcesSim.cxx is provided.)
