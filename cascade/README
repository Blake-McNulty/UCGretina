This is an example of generating events with gamma-ray multiplicity > 1

In cascade.mac, the initial excitation energy of the reaction product
is specified as usual:

/BeamOut/ProjectileExcitation 2000. keV

but an additional command:

/BeamOut/LevelSchemeFile levelScheme.dat

specifies a level scheme file, used to set up the decay properties of
the reaction product.

The file levelScheme.dat specifies the level scheme. For each state,
there must be a line giving the energy [keV], number of gamma-decay
branches, and mean lifetime [ps], followed by a line for each branch
with a branching ratio followed by the energy of the final state of the
transition. For example, the first three lines in levelScheme.dat
describe an excited state at 2000 keV which decays with zero lifetime
either to a state at 1400 keV with BR 0.25 or to a state at 1000 keV
with BR 0.75. 

In this example, we populate the 2000 keV state. The file
levelScheme.dat describes a level scheme giving two possible cascades: 

2000 -> 1500 -> 1200 -> 0 and 2000->1200->0

The spectrum will show gamma rays at 300, 500, 800, and 1200 keV.
