================================================================================
Version 1.3.0
================================================================================
L. Riley  March 2013

Added an optional level scheme file specifying the portion of the
	level scheme accessible via de-excitation of the initial
	state. Multiple decay branches, individual level lifetimes, and
	individual gamma-ray angular distributions are supported.
	(Individual gamma-ray angular distributions are implemented but
	untested.)

Updated Reaction.cc: The Reaction process now specifies its ProcessType
	(Decay) and ProcessSubType (DecayExt) for compatibility with the
	PhysicsListHelper class.

Improved walls file in the GretinaGeometry tree. The hexagonal front and
	back caps still generate convexity warnings, but they are now all
	below the 0.1 mm level.

================================================================================
Version 1.2.4
================================================================================
L. Riley  March 2013

Positions of gamma-ray interaction points are now consolidated with an
	energy-weighted sum in EventAction.cc. Consolidation is not done
	by default (PositionRes = 0. mm).

Added a sourceFrame "co56_2012" for the 56Co source (25mm x 25m x .4mm Fe)

Added "eu152_peaks" (9 selected peaks, equal intensities) and "co56_peaks"
	(11 selected peaks, equal intensities) source types. These are
	useful for photopeak efficiencies.

Updated Physics Lists for compatibility with future Geant4
	releases. (Switched from SetModel to SetEmModel method.)

Resolved issues with Geant4.9.6 in CConvexPolyhedron.cc. (G4Exception now
	requires at least four arguments.)

Updated Physics Lists for compatibility with future Geant4
	releases. (Switched from SetModel to SetEmModel method.)
================================================================================
Version 1.2.3
================================================================================
L. Riley  February 2013

Modified EventAction and EventAction_Messenger: interaction points can be
	written in crystal coordinates as expected in Mode 2 data.
	The world coordinate system can also be first rotated by Pi/2
	about z to match the GRETINA coordinate system.
================================================================================
Version 1.2.2
================================================================================
L. Riley  February 2013

Modified cluster, walls, and euler geometry files in the
	./GretinaGeometry/NSCL tree to arrange crystals to match
	the NSCL numbering scheme

Modified EventAction.cc to write crystal ID numbers to match the NSCL
	numbering scheme
================================================================================
Version 1.2.1
================================================================================
L. Riley  January 2013

Consolidated energies and positions for each event into interaction points
	that can be resolved by GRETINA to better simulate Mode 2 data.

================================================================================
Version 1.2
================================================================================
L. Riley  August 2012

Migrated the GRETINA array and NSCL mounting shell from v1.1 to the
	UCSeGA/UCCAESAR	skeleton.

Implemented the NSCL target sled.

================================================================================
Version 1.1
================================================================================
L. Riley, B. Roberts, B. Sadler   June-July 2012

Implementation of the GRETINA mounting shell used at the NSCL and the
	cryostats/LN Dewars

Improved outer wall model

================================================================================
Version 1.0
================================================================================
L. Riley   July 2011

Initial implementation of LH target and NSCL target
